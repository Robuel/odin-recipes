            <blockquote>
                <hr>
                <p>These are my favorite recipes and they mostly
                    consist of dishes that my dad and grandma used to make.
                    Most, if not all, of these recipes consist of pork and
                    are generally considered to be quite unhealthy, 
                    Nevertheless, these dishes are what I ate as I grew up with so they hold
                    a special very place to my heart. Also, just a warning,
                    but most of them are stews and soup dishes as that's what
                    we cooked most of the time in our home. It probably has
                    something to do with how stews and soups are great with 
                    rice or something.</p>

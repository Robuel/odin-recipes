        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p><h4>A very classic Filipino dish that I can guarantee you EVERY Filipino knows!
            It's quite simplistic since it's geenrally just a soup full of meat and vegetables.
            It gets better as the soup gets older (after a day) since the vegetables have more time
            to seep into the stew giving you a flavorful and hearty soup!

        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p><h4>This dish was something that my dad always made whenever I would request for it.
            It's the dish that's responsible for me liking beans which isn't quite common among
            Filipinos since everyone is addicted to rice. I like eating this dish with rice too,
            but it can get quite heavy so I prefer eating it as is. Just a bowl full of soft,
            tender red kidney beans with soft chunks of pork and fat swimming in a thick bean base
            flavored with paprika and smoked bacon bits.
